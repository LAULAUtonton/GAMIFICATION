title: "The Mystery of the Abandoned Theatre",
content: `
Last Saturday, our class visited an old theatre near the city centre. There was dust everywhere, and there were broken seats in the front rows. The building looked forgotten, but it also felt full of stories.

Our history teacher explained that the theatre opened in 1925. Many famous actors performed there. However, it closed twenty years ago after a fire damaged part of the roof.

While we were exploring the backstage area, we discovered old posters and costumes. There was even a small wooden box hidden behind a curtain.

Inside the box, there were letters written by actors who once worked there. They described exciting premieres and nervous opening nights.

Before leaving, we imagined how the theatre looked in the past. It wasn’t just an abandoned building — it was part of our town’s cultural history.

title: "A Strange Discovery at School",
content: `
Last month, students found a locked cabinet in the science lab. There was a label on it, but the writing was almost invisible.

Our teacher told us that the cabinet belonged to a former chemistry teacher. He worked at the school for thirty years before he retired.

When we opened it, we discovered notebooks filled with experiments and diagrams. Some pages described inventions that never became real projects.

There were also photographs of students from the 1980s. They looked proud of their scientific creations.

We realised that the cabinet wasn’t just old furniture. It was a reminder of the school’s history and creativity.

title: "While the Power Was Failing",
content: `
It was raining heavily when the lights suddenly went out in our neighbourhood. I was studying for an exam, and my parents were preparing dinner.

At first, we thought it was a normal power cut. However, the storm was getting stronger and the wind was shaking the windows.

While we were waiting, we heard a loud crash outside. A tree had fallen near our street.

Neighbours were using flashlights and checking if everyone was safe. Someone was calling the emergency services.

After two hours, the electricity returned. We were relieved and grateful that nobody was hurt.

title: "An Interview I Didn’t Expect",
content: `
I was walking to the library when my English teacher stopped me. She was organising a cultural event, and a local writer was visiting.

While other students were decorating the classroom, I was preparing interview questions.

During the interview, the writer explained how he was writing his first novel while working full time.

Suddenly, the fire alarm rang. Everyone was leaving the building when the author started laughing.

The alarm was false, but the experience became unforgettable.

id: "U3_T1",
title: "If We Protect the Park",
content: `
Our town is organising a community clean-up. If enough volunteers join, the park will look cleaner and safer.

If we collect plastic bottles, they will be recycled. If people see positive results, they will participate again.

Some students think it won’t change anything. However, if small actions continue, bigger improvements will follow.

If we work together, we will create a healthier environment for everyone.

{
id: "U3_T2",
title: "Healthy Habits for the Future",
content: `
If teenagers exercise regularly, they will improve their concentration at school.

If we sleep well, our mood will be better. If we reduce screen time, we will feel less stressed.

Some experts say that if families cook at home more often, children will develop healthier habits.

If we start today, we will notice changes very soon.

/* ================= UNIT 4 ================= */

{
id: "U4_T1",
title: "Our Summer Project",
content: `
This summer, our class is going to organise a charity event. We’re going to sell handmade products.

Some students think it will be difficult, but our teacher believes it will be successful.

We are going to promote it on social media, and we will invite local businesses.

I think we will learn teamwork and responsibility.

{
id: "U4_T2",
title: "Life in 2040",
content: `
Experts say cities will become smarter and greener. People will use electric transport, and buildings will produce renewable energy.

Students are going to use more digital tools in class. However, teachers will still guide learning.

Some jobs will disappear, but new ones will appear.

The future will bring challenges, but it will also offer opportunities.
