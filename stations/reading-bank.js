Last Friday, my friends and I visited an old factory near our town. There was a broken gate and there were pieces of metal on the ground. We felt nervous but curious.

Inside the building, there were large containers and old machines. Dust covered everything. Suddenly, we heard a loud noise upstairs. My friend Leo said it was probably the wind, but I wasn’t sure.

We walked carefully towards the stairs. There was a small light coming from one of the rooms. When we opened the door, we discovered a group of artists preparing an exhibition. They were using recycled materials to create sculptures.

They explained that the factory had closed years ago, and they wanted to transform it into a cultural space. We felt relieved and impressed.

At the end of the visit, we helped them move some materials. What started as a scary adventure became an unforgettable experience.

Last month, students at our school found a small metal box under a tree in the playground. There was a note attached to it. It said, “Open in 2024.”

Our teacher explained that it was a time capsule from twenty years ago. Inside, there were photos, letters and small objects. Some students had written about their favourite music and hobbies.

We read that in 2004, there were no smartphones in our school. Students listened to CDs and wrote letters instead of sending messages online.

One letter described how teenagers felt excited about the future. They believed technology would change everything. Reading their predictions made us smile.

We decided to create our own time capsule. We included drawings, class photos and messages about our lives today. We buried it in the same place, hoping future students will feel as surprised as we did.

It was getting dark while we were walking home from school. The sky was becoming grey and the wind was blowing strongly. I was carrying a cardboard model for my art project.

Suddenly, it started to rain heavily. We were running when a loud noise interrupted us. A tree branch fell in front of us.

While we were waiting under a bus stop, we saw an artist protecting his paintings. He was using plastic sheets to cover them.

After a few minutes, the storm stopped. We continued our way home, laughing about the adventure. Later, I realised that I was feeling proud because we stayed calm during the storm.

It wasn’t a terrible day. It was an unusual one.

I was preparing my homework when my teacher called me. She said a famous street artist was visiting our school, and she asked if I wanted to interview him.

While students were organising the exhibition, I was writing my questions. I was feeling nervous because it was my first interview.

The artist explained that he started painting when he was a teenager. He described how he was creating murals while other children were playing outside.

When the interview ended, I felt proud. It was an enormous opportunity. I learned that passion and practice are more important than talent.

Our town is planning an outdoor festival near the lake. If the weather is good, many families will attend. There will be music concerts, food trucks and cycling activities.

The organisers say that if volunteers help, the event will run smoothly. If we collect enough money, we will donate it to a local charity.

Some students are worried about the environment. They believe that if people leave rubbish behind, the park will become dirty.

However, if everyone respects the rules, the festival will be a success. I think it will become a yearly tradition.

Taking care of our health today will protect our future.
