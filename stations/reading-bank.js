Last Friday, my friends and I visited an old factory near our town.

Last month, students at our school found a small metal box under a tree.
Inside, there were photos, letters and small objects.

We read that in 2004 there were no smartphones.
Students listened to CDs and wrote letters.

We decided to create our own time capsule for future students.
